# TicTacToe_Cpp
> Old but SOLID gold tic-tac-toe game with additional mode of playing PvC on three different levels.

## General Information
The project aims to make it possible to play tic-tac-toe against a friend and against the computer at three different levels:
- easy level, the player always starts and the computer puts a mark in random places,
- medium level, the player or the computer randomly starts, the computer tries to win when there is a possibility, and also to block the player from winning,
- hard level, the computer always starts from the middle field and according to the algorithm tries to win the game, attention one wrong move and you lost.

The project is very simple, its main goal was to learn Object Oriented Programming and create the first multi-file program in Visual Studio Code, as well as to improve the use of the basic elements of the C++ language, such as loops, arrays, string, enum, switch cases, pseudo-randomness, working on relationships and managing functions, as well as learning to use SOLID and correct patterns.

## Technologies Used
The whole project is written in C++ language and uses such libraries as:
- string
- iostream
- unistd.h

## Features
- The program uses basic functions from the string library, which makes it easier to work with text and will facilitate future modifications,
- The game relies on arrays to allow characters to be inserted at the desired location,
- The program uses pseudo-random numbers for the PvC game,
- Enum enumeration type is used to create more readable and understandable code,
- Object-oriented programming, encapsulation, the principle of single responsibility of functions were used.

## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_.
